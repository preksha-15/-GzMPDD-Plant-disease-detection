# -GzMPDD-Plant-disease-detection
AI-based Generalizable Model to detect plant leaf disease using YOLOv8n.
**Introduction**
This project, GzMPDD, develops a generalizable AI model using YOLOv8n to detect plant leaf diseases. It addresses the limitations of current models by providing a robust, real-time solution for farmers and agricultural professionals to identify diseases across various plant species.

**Features**
1) Generalizable Disease Detection: Identifies diseases across diverse plant species.
2) Background Noise Mitigation: Improves accuracy by removing background elements from images.
3) Dual-Dataset Approach: Enhances generalization using both primary and auxiliary datasets.
4) Real-time Performance: Lightweight YOLOv8n architecture for fast, mobile-compatible detection.

**Proposed Methodology** 
The system uses a three-phase approach:
1) Background Removal: Isolates plant leaves.
2) Disease Detection with YOLOv8n: Analyzes images for diseases.
3) Cross-Species Disease Mapping: Extends detection to new plant species.
